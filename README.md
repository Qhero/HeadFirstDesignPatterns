# HeadFirstDesignPatterns
This project is about educating myself on Design Patterns with the book Head First Design Patterns.

All code are writed in C# instead of Java :)

Other links for the book are available on the book page at <a href="http://www.wickedlysmart.com/head-first-design-patterns/">wickedlysmart.com.</a>

# Strategic Pattern

"Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and make them intergeable. Strategy lets the algoithm vary independently from clients that use it."

# Observer Pattern and ObserverDotNet Pattern

"Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that wen one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically."

# OO basics

<ul>
  <li>Abstraction : abstracting away the details, in order to focus on what is important.</li>  
  <li>Encapsulation : a group of related properties, methods, and other members are treated as a single unit or object.</li>  
  <li>Polymorphism : multiple classes that can be used interchangeably, even though each class implements the same properties or methods in different ways.</li>  
  <li>Inheritance: ability to create new classes based on an existing class.</li>  
</ul>

# OO Principles

<ul>
  <li>Encapsulate what varies.</li>  
  <li>Favor composition over inheritance.</li>  
  <li>Program to interfaces, not implementations.</li>  
  <li>Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.</li>  
</ul>
